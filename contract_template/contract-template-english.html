<h2>Design/development contract</h2>
<p><b>Between</b> [company name] <b>And</b> [customer name]</p>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>We’ll always do our best to fulfil your needs and meet your 
expectations, but it’s important to have things written down so that we 
both know what’s what, who should do what and when, and what will happen
 if something goes wrong. You won’t find any complicated legal terms or 
long passages of unreadable text in this contract. We’ve no desire to 
trick you into signing something you might regret later. We do want 
what’s best for both parties, so in short;</p>
<p>You (<ins>[customer name]</ins>), located at <ins>[address]</ins> (“You”) are hiring us (<ins>[company name]</ins>) (“We or Us”) to:</p>
<p><ins>[Design and develop a web site]</ins></p>
<p>For the estimated total price of <ins>[total]</ins> as outlined in our previous correspondence.</p>
<p>Of course it’s a little more complicated, but we’ll get to that.</p>


<div>
<h3>What both parties agree to</h3>
<p>
<b>You</b>
: You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of 
yourself, your company or your organisation. You’ll give us the assets 
and information we need to complete the project. You’ll do this when we 
ask and provide the formats we ask for. You’ll review our work, provide 
feedback and approval in a timely manner too. Deadlines work two ways, 
so you’ll also be bound by dates we set together. You also agree to 
stick to the payment schedule at the end of this contract.</p>
<p>
<b>Us</b>
: We have the experience and ability to deliver everything we’ve agreed 
with you and we’ll do it all in a professional and timely manner. We’ll 
endeavour to meet every deadline that’s set and on top of that we’ll 
maintain the confidentiality of everything you give us.</p>
<p>By signing this contract, you agree to the following:</p>
<hr>
<h3>Design services</h3>
<p>We’ll create responsive designs which adapt to the capabilities of 
many devices and screen sizes. To give you a better understanding of our
 designs, we’ll use HTML and CSS predominantly which will also avoid us 
wasting time mocking up every template as a static visual. Sometimes, 
we’ll use visuals to indicate a creative direction (colour, texture and 
typography.)</p>
<p>You’ll have plenty of opportunities to review our work and provide 
feedback. We’ll share either a Dropbox, Google Drive folder or Github 
repository or a development site with you. We’ll have regular, possibly 
daily, contact by phone, Slack, or Zoom.</p>
<p>If—at any stage—you change your mind about our deliverables or aren’t
 happy with our work, you’ll pay us in full for the time we’ve spent 
working with you. Then, we agree to terminate this contract.</p>
<h3>Written content</h3>
<p>Unless agreed separately, we’re not responsible for uploading text or
 images to your website or creating every page. We provide professional 
copywriting and editing services, so if you’d like us to create, edit, 
or input content for you, we’ll provide a separate estimate.</p>
<h3>Graphics and photographs</h3>
<p>You will supply graphic files in an editable, vector digital format 
including Adobe Illustrator (Ai) or EPS. You will provide high 
resolution digital photographs. If your design requires stock images, 
these assets—and the time we spend selecting them—aren’t included in our
 price. We can provide a separate estimate for stock images and 
research.</p>
<h3>Changes and revisions</h3>
<p>We won’t limit your ability to change your mind. Our price is based 
on the number of weeks we estimate are needed to deliver everything 
we’ve agreed to achieve. If you change your mind, adding extra work 
won’t be a problem and we’re happy to be flexible. We’ll provide a 
separate estimate for any additional work.</p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>You understand that browser testing no longer means attempting to 
make a website look the same in browsers of different capabilities or on
 devices with different size screens. You agree it does mean ensuring 
someone’s experience of a design should be appropriate to the 
capabilities of their browser or device.</p>
<p>We will test our work only in current versions of major desktop 
browsers including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), 
Microsoft (Edge), and Mozilla (Firefox.) We won’t test in older versions
 unless agreed separately. If you need an enhanced design for an older 
browser or specific device, we will provide a separate estimate for 
that. We will test your design using the latest versions of:</p>
<p><b>iOS</b>: Safari on iPhone and iPad<br>
<b>Android</b>: Google Chrome</p>
<p>We won’t test specific Android devices, or other mobile browsers 
unless we agreed separately. If you need us to test using alternative 
devices, we will provide a separate estimate.</p>
<h3>Delivery and backup</h3>
<p>At the start of the project, you’ll set up a free Github account. 
We’ll use this account to deliver HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, as 
well as production and optimised images. You will retain these files as 
we’re not required to keep copies.</p>
<h3>Search engine optimisation (SEO)</h3>
<p>You understand we don’t guarantee improvements to your search engine 
ranking, but that the websites we develop are accessible to search 
engines.</p>
<h3>Hosting</h3>
<p>We’re a design company—not a hosting company—so we don’t offer 
support for website hosting, email, or other technical services. You may
 already have professional hosting and you might even manage that 
hosting in-house; if you do, great. If you don’t already have hosting, 
we’ll recommend a provider and ask you to set up an account.</p>
<p>Setting up your website on a server and adding analytics software is 
included in our price. After that, updates to your website and 
management of your hosting will be up to you.</p>
<h3>Legal stuff and nonsense</h3>
<p>We carry out work in accordance with good industry practice and at 
the standard expected from qualified people with relevant experience. 
That said, we can’t guarantee our work will be free from errors. We 
won’t be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost 
profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special 
damages, even if you’ve advised us of them.</p>
<p>Your liability to us will be limited only to the price stated in this
 contract. You won’t be liable to us or any third-party for damages, 
including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential 
or special damages, even if we’ve advised you of them.</p>
<p>Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, 
or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed 
severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and 
enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>
<p>Phew.</p>
<h3>Intellectual property rights</h3>
<p>You guarantee the written content you provide is original, or that 
you have the rights to use it. You also guarantee you have licences to 
use images which are owned by photographers or have been purchased from 
stock libraries. You agree to protect us from any claim by owners of 
copyrighted material. When our work requires licensed fonts or images 
from stock libraries, we’ll ask you to purchase them so you’ll be 
licensed to use them.We guarantee our work is original. When you’ve paid
 us in full—and if this contract hasn’t been terminated—we’ll assign 
intellectual property rights to you as follows:</p>
<p>You’ll own the graphic files we produce during your project. We’ll give you permission to use these files for any purpose.</p>
<p>We’ll own the unique combination of elements which constitute the 
complete design. We’ll license it to you, exclusively and in perpetuity,
 for this project only.</p>
<h3>Displaying our work</h3>
<p>We love to show off, so we reserve the right to display any aspect of
 our work as long as doing so doesn’t breach any confidentiality 
agreement. This may include sketches, work-in-progress designs and the 
finished project on our website, in magazine articles, or in books.</p>
<h3>Payment schedule</h3>
<p>You understand how important it is for a small business that you pay 
your bills promptly. We’re also sure you’ll want to stay friends, so you
 agree to stick tightly to the following payment schedule.</p>
<p><ins>[Payment details]</ins><br>
<ins>[Payment schedule]</ins></p>
<p>Our payment terms are <ins>[number]</ins> days from the date of 
invoice. We issue invoices electronically and our bank account details 
will be included. Our invoices will be in <ins>[currency]</ins>. If your currency is different, you agree your payments will be the same value.</p>
<p>You agree to pay all charges associated with international transfers 
of funds. We reserve the right to charge interest on all overdue debts 
at the rate of <ins>[percentage]</ins> per month or part of a month.</p>
<h3>But where’s all the small print?</h3>
<p>Just like a parking ticket, neither of us can transfer this contract to anyone else without the other’s permission.</p>
<p>We both agree to adhere to laws and regulations in relation to our 
activities under this contract and not to cause the other to breach any 
relevant laws or regulations.</p>
<p>This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. Although its 
language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a 
legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of English and Welsh courts.</p>
